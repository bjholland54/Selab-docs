### SFDC Activities
All your customer activities need to be recorded **weekly (including EE)**.  All definitely before the end of the month using the correct Opportunity record.  Dashboard information is tied directly to this.

## MBOs

### MBO Credit - General Information
Now that we have started to create some of our targeted deliverables, we must follow the process set forth by the CoE.  Use the [Sales Edge Presale Portal UPDATE](https://bmc.seismic.com/X5/#/home) to upload your content to the COE.

*** Important note:  Do not submit an artifact to this site until your Manager reviews first.  Managers must ensure 90% readiness prior to BPC assistance ***

The MBO tracking and Credit request page is available [here UPDATE](https://bmcsoftware.gosavo.com/CustomPage/View.aspx?id=40137615)  

In all cases, there are at least two different entries that are required:

* Salesforce to capture time

* SharePoint to capture completion for MBO  Reporting

The necessary Sharepoint lists can be found [here](https://bmcsoftware.sharepoint.com/sites/PreSalesCOESite/PreSalesMBOCreditSubmissions/)

### Center of Excellence (CoE) – MBO uploads

Teams,

Now that we have started to create some of our targeted deliverables, we must follow the process set forth by the CoE. Use the [Sales Edge Presale Portal UPDATE](https://bmc.seismic.com/X5/#/home) to upload your content to the COE.  
*** Important note:  Do not submit an artifact to this site until your Manager reviews first.  Managers must ensure 90% readiness prior to BPC assistance ***

### Recording Activities

Switching Activity time to another Opportunity

Using the “Relate To” you can switch your activity time from an Account or Opportunity to another Opportunity easily.  

1. Locate your activity entry
![](../images/rec_act1.png)
2. If switching from “Account” to “Opportunity”, use the drop down on the “Relate To” record and switch to “Opportunity”.  If going from “Opportunity” to “Opportunity” skip to step 3.
3. Select the “magnify glass” icon and then select the appropriate Opportunity
![](../images/rec_act3.png)
![](../images/rec_act4.png)
4. Now “Save”.  Your activity hours should now be reflected on the new Opportunity you’ve selected.

### External Surveys
The Sesmic document is located [here UPDATE](https://bmcsoftware.gosavo.com/Document/Document.aspx?id=48997818&view=)

The Process:

1. Check if your contact recipient is  in the Opt Out list

    * Check the slides in Sales Edge for the latest link to the Opt Out information.

2. Compose the email using the template as a model

    * Check the Sales Edge template in case there were revisions (GDPR, or other regulations notices may be added in the future).  

![](../images/ext_sur.PNG)

3. Send it

4. Check the MBO Dashboard to see if the response is recorded.

## Career Management
### The process
1. Enter goals related to the quarter.

    * You may be able to copy them from other quarter (See this page)

    * Enter the description and success criteria

2. Do not mark them complete until they are done, as they cannot be changed

3. When they are completed, submit it to your manager

### Copy Goals from Prior Quarters

1. In case you didn’t know you can select your Q3 goals by using the drop down
![](../images/copy_goals.jpeg)
2. Then select a KPI (goal) and use the drop down and select copy
![](../images/copy_goals1.jpeg)
3. Next using the drop downs change “Review Period” and “Target Goal period” to Q4.
![](../images/copy_goals2.jpeg)
4. Now you just need to change the success criteria and/or description if needed.

## EEDs
### Perspectives
Perspectives examples can be found on our PreSales Portal in Sales Edge [here UPDATE](https://bmcsoftware.gosavo.com/CustomPage/View.aspx?id=38017393)  
Make sure to record the Perspective in the EE of SFDC.  (i.e, Planned, In Progress, Completed)  
Once at least 90% completed the Perspective must be uploaded to Sales Edge.       
To build an outstanding Perspective, please allow 1 to 3 weeks depending on the complexity of your document.  
To receive credit, the perspective must be on Sales Edge on the general area, and the link copied on the ED record.
