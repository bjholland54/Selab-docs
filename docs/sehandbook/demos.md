## Documentation

Documentation about the Demo system can be found on the Teams wiki [here](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3Aeaeb5dd73f564b1da3f9c70f22766d35%40thread.skype/tab%3A%3Aa6a88efe-78ca-4d44-82fe-1c7044c7fa75 ).

## Software

### Electronic Product Download (EPD)

You cannot access EPD with your AD id, but you will need to create an ID with your long email address (name_lastname@bmc.com) (similar for tickets).

Since access is through Okta, you cannot be logged in to both Support and your ID.

To facilitate this, use the Private Session of your browser when logging to Support for tickets or EPD.

## Environment
