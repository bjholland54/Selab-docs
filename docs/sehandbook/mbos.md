### Recording Activities

Switching Activity time to another Opportunity

Using the “Relate To” you can switch your activity time from an Account or Opportunity to another Opportunity easily.  

1. Locate your activity entry
![](../images/rec_act1.png)
2. If switching from “Account” to “Opportunity”, use the drop down on the “Relate To” record and switch to “Opportunity”.  If going from “Opportunity” to “Opportunity” skip to step 3.
3. Select the “magnify glass” icon and then select the appropriate Opportunity
![](../images/rec_act3.png)
![](../images/rec_act4.png)
4. Now “Save”.  Your activity hours should now be reflected on the new Opportunity you’ve selected.

### External Surveys
The PreSales External Customer Survey document is located [here](https://bmcsoftware.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/sites/PreSalesCOESite/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B10EEF4CE-2228-47CC-BDE6-56FD5A1554A9%7D&file=PreSales%20External%20Customer%20Survey.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1)

The Process:

    * Check the Sales Edge template in case there were revisions (GDPR, or other regulations notices may be added in the future).  

![](../images/ext_sur.PNG)

3. Send it

4. Check the MBO Dashboard to see if the response is recorded.

## Career Management
### The process
1. Enter goals related to the quarter.

    * You may be able to copy them from other quarter (See this page)

    * Enter the description and success criteria

2. Do not mark them complete until they are done, as they cannot be changed

3. When they are completed, submit it to your manager

### Copy Goals from Prior Quarters

1. In case you didn’t know you can select your Q3 goals by using the drop down
![](../images/copy_goals.jpeg)
2. Then select a KPI (goal) and use the drop down and select copy
![](../images/copy_goals1.jpeg)
3. Next using the drop downs change “Review Period” and “Target Goal period” to Q4.

4. Now you just need to change the success criteria and/or description if needed.

6. If you have a specific day that you would like the blog published, email Jana ahead of time so she can add it to the editorial calendar.
