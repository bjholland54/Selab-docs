### Benefits

#### PTO

Below are the numbers of days you are eligible for based on the number of service years.  Also included is the Daily Accrual for employees that have been with BMC for less than one year.

Also don’t forget as BMC employees we do get floating Holidays as per the BMC Holidays calendar.

Vacation time allows employees to utilize a defined amount of PTO for leave that is not covered in other types of leave. For example, vacation time can be used to handle personal business.

In the first partial calendar year of hire as a full-time BMC employee, an employee will accrue the pro-rata equivalent of 15 days per year, calculated on a daily basis (.041 days of vacation time per calendar day).  Beginning in the first full calendar year after your hire date, the following schedule applies:  

In the calendar year that an employee reaches the next service level (5 or 10 years),  the employee is eligible for the next level of vacation time.

| Years of Service | Annual Accrual   | Daily Accrual |
