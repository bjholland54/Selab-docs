## git 

First, the definition, from Wikipedia:  

    Git is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files and
    coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It is primarily used for 
    source code management in software development, but it can be used to keep track 
    of changes in any set of files. As a distributed revision control system, it is 
    aimed at speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.  

## GitLab 

First, what is GitLab?
 
    GitLab is a web-based Git-repository manager with wiki, issue-tracking and CI/CD 
    pipeline features, using an open-source license, developed by GitLab Inc. From 
    project planning and source code management to CI/CD and monitoring, GitLab is a 
    single application for the entire DevOps lifecycle.
