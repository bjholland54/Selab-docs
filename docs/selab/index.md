# Control-M SELab Overview

## Overview

The Control-M SELab (Solution Engineering Lab) is an internal cloud platform
for Control-M Solution Engineers to demo, develop, and deliver Control-M
anything. It's *"the last word in demo systems and dev environments"* for
Control-M Solution Engineering.

## Concept

The original concept of the SELab comes from the work done by the Control-M I2T
Team for the Tel Aviv Lab environment.

## SELab Environment

The SELab environment consists of the following components:  
The Administrative Stack  
The Control-M Stack  
The Linux Runner machines

## git

First, the definition, from Wikipedia:  

    Git is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files and
    coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It is primarily used for
    source code management in software development, but it can be used to keep track
    of changes in any set of files. As a distributed revision control system, it is
    aimed at speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.  

## GitLab

First, what is GitLab?

    GitLab is a web-based Git-repository manager with wiki, issue-tracking and CI/CD
    pipeline features, using an open-source license, developed by GitLab Inc. From
    project planning and source code management to CI/CD and monitoring, GitLab is a
    single application for the entire DevOps lifecycle.

## Legacy Systems

There are currently two legacy systems that are still active and used. They
will be considered "deprecated" once the SELab gets to a point where the
functionality they provide is considered
