### Benefits

#### PTO

Below are the numbers of days you are eligible for based on the number of service years.  Also included is the Daily Accrual for employees that have been with BMC for less than one year.

Also don’t forget as BMC employees we do get floating Holidays as per the BMC Holidays calendar.

Vacation time allows employees to utilize a defined amount of PTO for leave that is not covered in other types of leave. For example, vacation time can be used to handle personal business.

In the first partial calendar year of hire as a full-time BMC employee, an employee will accrue the pro-rata equivalent of 15 days per year, calculated on a daily basis (.041 days of vacation time per calendar day).  Beginning in the first full calendar year after your hire date, the following schedule applies:  

In the calendar year that an employee reaches the next service level (5 or 10 years),  the employee is eligible for the next level of vacation time.

| Years of Service | Annual Accrual   | Daily Accrual |
|------------|-----------------------|---------------------|
| 1 to 4    | 15 days      | 0.041 |
| 5 to 9     | 20 days  | 0.055 |
| 10 | 25 days (maximum) | 0.068 |

### Searching Customer Support Cases

In the past many of you used Remedy to look up customer cases.  As you are aware we have switched over to Service Cloud offering from SFDC.  You should now all have read access to the “Cases” tab.  You can view the tab by following the blue steps in the attached image, or add “Cases” to your tabs list by following the red steps.  After that you can customize your view by Cloning the default view, rename and then apply some filters to search for on Control-M cases, which is what I did.   If you encounter a problem, go to Chatter > Groups > Service Cloud @ BMC   and request for help.

## Expenses

### Travel Policy

For more information visit [Travel and Expense Policy](https://my-bmc.com/download/departments/legal_site/policies_and_guidelines/corporate_policy_documents/travel_and_expense_policy/travel_and_expense_policypdf~2?attachment=0)

![](../images/concur_icon.png)

### NA Expenses
**Travel and Business Expense policy**

No per diems.  For meals you will expense out each meal and the total for the day will be reimbursed up to the $70 limit.

U.S. Employees traveling internationally will be reimbursed up to $100 per day for actual Meals & Entertainment expenses. If traveling within the U.S., this reimbursement is on expenses up to $70 per day. These reimbursements are not per diems, as they are only applied against incurred expenses. U.S. employees are no longer subject to per diems unless otherwise specified, such as part of a Consulting Services engagement (refer to Section 4.22).

**You have 30 days to submit your expenses**

### Correcting Policy Violations

Many expense reports that contain “Expense Violations” can be eliminated by your correct entry.
The 2 most common “expense violations” received are:

* Lodging  
* Car Rental

The situation:  

* You use the Amex credit card pull which contains the total amount of the bill.  If this is for 1 day only then generally there is not a problem.  The violation occurs when you have a multi-day charge (Lodging and/or Car Rental).  The default number of days for the total charge is 1 day.  The system will create a violation as being an excessive charge for 1 day based on BMC guidelines.

To correct:

* You must itemize the expense
* Change the “Daily Rate” to whatever the 1 day rate is, including taxes
* Change the “Number of Days” to the correct amount of days.
* Sometimes you may have to eat a penny to round things off.
